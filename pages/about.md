## Olá 👋

My name is <a href="{{ site.linkedin }}">Olga</a> and I am a **Cyber Security Engineer** from Portugal.

I have been working as a Cyber Security Engineer since February 2019, when I started developing my MSc Thesis and rediscovered my love of writing.

This is my personal site where I share resources I use as I learn and grow in the security field, among other things that I am interested in and believe contribute to my personal and professional growth.
Overall, this site will capture <a href="/posts">posts</a> about #incident_response, #malware, #code, #ctf, #learning, #listening, and my endless obsession with #organization.




## Some trivia about me:
* ⚔️ I love fiction. Give me any book, movie or tv series with dragons and epic quests and I am forever happy.
* 🥘 I do a mean veggie loaded nachos.
* 🧟‍♀ I am working on my survival pack and strategy for a zombie apocalypse.
* 📝 I am learning French. (If you are French, want to learn Portuguese and can speak English, let's practice together!)
