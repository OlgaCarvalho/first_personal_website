2021 was a very particular year. Mid Covid-19 pandemic with scheduled isolations, it brought hardships to us all. However, it is important to look back and also celebrate important accomplishments in our life. As such, I wanted to write this post to remind myself of the interesting achievements at a professional level.

* I joined the job market with a LinkedIn account.
* I joined Portuguese Women in Tech mentorship program.
* My research fellowship was renewed.
* I installed and used for the first time Kali Linux (a staple in cyber security).
* I created my first CV to my liking. No more EuroPass!
* I subscribed and finished *Introduction to Networking* online course by New York University (NYU).
* I went to my very first interview in the cyber security field. It ended up being for a development position but it was good practice. 
* I took a certification of Information Security Associate on ISO/IEC 27001.
* I joined my first webinar in cybersecurity: Cyber Threat Intelligence & Forensics Analysis
* I launched this personal website.
* I had my first meeting with a client. (I was so nervous, but it went so well!)
* I changed jobs to exactly what I wanted to do!
* I did my first ever work trip (to Paris).
* I did my first forensics investigation.
* And the year ended with very good news: my MSc thesis' article was accepted to the Symposium on Applied Computing (SAP) conference, happening next year (2022).



*Tip:* There is an app called *PepTalkHer* that helps you save any event and celebrate your wins! Go check it out.
