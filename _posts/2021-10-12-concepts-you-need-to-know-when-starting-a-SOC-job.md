# Concepts you need to known when starting on a SOC

Recently I have started a job in a SOC (Security Operations Center) for the first time.

When you start working in a new company it is normal to notice there are abbreviations the team already uses daily. If you're a junior starting a new job probably you won't know the meaning of many, even though some could be obvious, since you are not used to the abbreviation itself it's normal to feel a little lost in the first conversations with your colleagues.

Here I've compiled every abbreviation I encountered during my first month on the job. Feel free to browse trough if you are starting like me, or if you want to empower a new on-boarder to feel more confident.

Let me know if you would like me to add more to this list.
