## Olá 👋

My name is <a href="{{ site.linkedin }}">Olga</a> and I am a **Cyber Security Engineer** from Portugal.

Since I had my first contact with cyber security, during a MSc course called *Criptography and Communications Security*, I knew this was the field I wanted to work on.

Wanting to learn more, I developed BIA (**B**usiness **I**mpact **A**ssessment) during my dissertation, as a researcher fellow at [INOV](https://www.inov.pt/)'s cyber security department.
BIA allows to simulate how a cyber-threat can impact the goal of an organization (i.e. business) to reduce system defenders workload and provide a higher-level of situational awareness.

After finishing my MSc, I stayed on as a cyber security engineer, primarily working on a new solution to scanless monitor vulnerabilities.

I’m also a part of the Mentorship program of [Portuguese Women in Tech](https://www.portuguesewomenintech.com/), where I met amazing women in tech that inspired me to go for what I want.
One direct result was moving the idea for this website from "coming soon" to "welcome to my page!". 🙌

Here, I hope to document my journey in the security field.



## Some trivia about me:
* ⚔️ I love fantasy! Give me any book with dragons and epic quests and I am forever content.
* 🥘 I do a mean veggie loaded nachos.
* 📝 I am learning French. (If you are French, want to learn Portuguese and can speak English, let's practice together!)
