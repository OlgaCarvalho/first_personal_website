# First post ever
Finally got around to getting this page up!

Using **Jekyll** I can use Markdown to author my posts.

(it is a test post but I am keeping this up.)

[Update:] it took me 10 days to have a first version ready. Don't be afraid, since I didn't use a template (I wanted to learn more about frontend) it took me a bit longer.
