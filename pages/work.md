## 📐 Engineer
#### Personal website
[This website](https://olgacarvalho.github.io/) uses Jekyll static code generator leveraging Markdown files, perfect for blogging :)

#### Business Impact Assessment (MSc Thesis)
Established security mechanisms, such as antivirus software, log analyzers and intrusion-detection systems, generally focus on low-level events and report them independently.
To help determine whether a cyber-incident has any current or future negative impact on the organization’s monitored network and goals, research in mission impact assessment tries to estimate that impact.
In this context, **BIA (Business Impact Assessment)** was created as a simulation platform, where one is able to simulate business-process impact by a cyber-threat landscape affecting organizational assets.
