## Olá 👋

My name is <a href="{{ site.linkedin }}">Olga</a> and I am a **Cyber Security Engineer** from Portugal.

I had my first contact with cyber security during a MSc course called *Criptography and Communications Security*.
This was when the fireworks 🎇 went off and I realized this was it, this was my purpose!

Wanting to learn more I focused my dissertation in the field: I developed a solution that aids system defenders analyze the impact of cyber-threats, directly onto business-processes.

This was done as a researcher fellow in [INOV](https://www.inov.pt/)'s cyber security department. After finishing my MSc, I stayed on as a cyber security engineer, primarily working on a new solution to scanless monitor vulnerabilities.

I’m also a part of the Mentorship program of [Portuguese Women in Tech](https://www.portuguesewomenintech.com/), where I met amazing women in tech that inspired me to go for what I want.
One direct result was moving the idea for this website from "coming soon" to "welcome to my page!". 🙌

Here, I hope to document my journey in the security field.



## Some trivia about me:
* ⚔️ I love fiction. Give me any book, movie or tv series with dragons and epic quests and I am forever happy.
* 🥘 I do a mean veggie loaded nachos.
* 📝 I am learning French. (If you are French, want to learn Portuguese and can speak English, let's practice together!)
