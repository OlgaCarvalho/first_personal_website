### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my page!

I'm Olga, a Cyber Security Engineer.

This is my personal site where I share what I learn as I grow in the security field, among other things that I am interested in and believe contribute to my professional growth. Iâ€™m hoping it will help others who are interested in the field or who are also just getting started like me.

Overall, this site will capture <a href="/posts">posts</a> about #incident_analysis, #malware, #code, #ctf, #learning, #listening, and my endless obsession with #organization.

You can learn a bit more <a href="/about">about</a> me and my experience on <a href="{{ site.linkedin }}">LinkedIn</a>.
