# About | Olga Carvalho

## Olá 👋

My name is <a href="{{ site.linkedin }}">Olga</a> and I am a **Cyber Security Engineer** from Portugal.

Since I had my first contact with cyber security, during a MSc course called *Criptography and Communications Security*, I knew this was the field I wanted to work on.

Wanting to learn more, during my dissertation I developed a solution - **B**usiness **I**mpact **A**ssessment (BIA) - to aid systems defenders analyze the impact a cyber-incident can have on an organization. BIA accomplishes this by simulating the impact of cyber-threats directly onto business-processes, providing a higher-level of situational awareness to responders.

After finishing my MSc, I stayed on as a cyber security engineer, primarily to research and develop a new solution to scanless monitor vulnerabilities. Now, I am working in a SOC, exactly as the system defender/responder BIA was created to help.

I’m also a part of the Mentorship program #2 by [Portuguese Women in Tech](https://www.portuguesewomenintech.com/), where I met amazing women in tech that inspired me to go for what I want.
One direct result was moving the idea for this website from "coming soon" to "welcome to my page!". 🙌

Here, I hope to document my journey in the security field.



## Some trivia about me:
* ⚔️ I love fantasy! Give me any book with dragons and epic quests and I am forever content.
* 🥘 I do a mean veggie loaded nachos.
* 📝 I am learning French. (If you are French, want to learn Portuguese and can speak English, let's practice together!)
